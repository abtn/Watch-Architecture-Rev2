# Watch — Persistent, Evidence-Oriented Team System

Watch is designed to turn temporary model workers into durable, auditable team experience. Model workers propose; application code validates and commits; durable records preserve what the system learned and did.

> **Model intelligence is temporary. Team experience is persistent.**

## Architecture in one line

**Reactive or deliberative entry → ordinary Task → Worker proposal → application validation → Kernel/application commit → durable records and Events.**

A Plan is intended work, not execution truth. Tasks and Events record execution. Derived assessments do not become authority merely because a model produced them.

## Repository guide

- [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) — current milestone status, gates, and next action.
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — instructions for coding agents.
- [`CHANGE_MAP.md`](CHANGE_MAP.md) — authority map for concepts.
- [`docs/control-model.md`](docs/control-model.md) — Objective, StateAssessment, Strategy, Plan, and the dual-entry model.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — general/original architecture for concepts not replaced by Revision 2.
- [`docs/invariants.md`](docs/invariants.md) — architectural invariants.
- [`docs/tasks.md`](docs/tasks.md) — Task specifications, write scopes, and budgets.
- [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md) — concise decision index; full ADRs are under `docs/decisions/`.
- [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) — test and verification strategy.

## Technical baseline

Python 3.12+, SQLAlchemy 2, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Alembic, `uv`, pytest, Ruff, and mypy. See `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `compose.yaml` for the executable configuration.

## Development rule

Make small, testable changes under the authority defined by `PLAN.md`, `CHANGE_MAP.md`, and the relevant spec/ADR. If the sources conflict or a milestone gate is blocked, stop and report rather than guessing. See `AGENTS.md` for the operating contract.
